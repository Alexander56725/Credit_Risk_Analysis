Credit Risk Resampling 

Overview of the Analysis


The purpose of the analysis was to look at the different techniques available to train and evaluate mdoels with imbalanced classes. In the model we tested sample data that looked at varied demographics, loan details, etc.

With the data available to us, we were able to pull in the data and examine through different variables what kind of loans would be noticed as high or low risk loans. 

In the process of machine learning with the data provided, we saw that the data was more heavily sided towards low risk loans and through including various variables, we were able to deduce if a loan was low risk or high risk. The two models we were establishing was the Logistic Regression model as well as resampled data (to include the lower amounts of data for high risk  loans).


Two 

Results
Model 1:

Balance Accuracy = 94.4%. Could accurately predict which loans would be high risk or low risk.
Precision = 100% for heatlhy  loans and 94% for high risk loans
Recall= 94% for healthy loans and 91% for high risk loans 

Model 2:

Balance Accuracy = 62.4%. Could accurately predict which loans would be high risk or low risk.
Precision = 100% for heatlhy  loans and 94% for high risk loans
Recall= 94% for healthy loans and 91% for high risk loans 


Summary

In all, both machine learning models have a great sense of accuracy (but model 1 came in higher), demonstrting both models can accurately predicate the status of a loan.
